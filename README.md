# Global Sensitivity Analysis of an ODE Model for sRNA-RNA interaction

This repository contains R scripts to perform a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) using Sobol' methods on an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model for sRNA-RNA interaction, as described in the paper "Harnessing small RNAs as synthetic post-transcriptional regulators in prokaryotes" (DOI). The analysis aims to identify which model parameters most significantly influence a defined output metric, considering both individual (first-order) and total-order effects (including interactions).

## Methodology Overview

The GSA process involves the following key steps, implemented in the scripts:

1.  **Model Definition**: An ODE model describing the system dynamics is defined.
2.  **Output Metric**: A specific output metric is calculated from the steady-state or time-course simulation of the ODE model. In this example, it's "Protein Regulation Strength," calculated as the log2 fold change of protein concentration under a specific condition versus a baseline condition.
3.  **Parameter Definition**: Model parameters for GSA are identified, along with their uncertainty ranges and sampling distributions (uniform or log-uniform).
4.  **Sobol' Sampling**: Sobol's quasi-random sampling method is used to generate parameter sets from the defined ranges and distributions. This method is efficient for exploring the parameter space and calculating sensitivity indices. The `sensitivity::sobolSalt` function is used.
5.  **Model Execution**: The ODE model is run for each parameter set generated by the Sobol' sequence. This step is parallelized here.
6.  **Sensitivity Indices Calculation**: First-order (S1) and total-order (ST) Sobol' sensitivity indices are calculated.
    * S1: Measures the contribution of a single parameter's variance to the output variance (main effect).
    * ST: Measures the total contribution of a parameter, including its main effect and all interactions with other parameters.
7.  **Result Visualization & Storage**: Sobol indices are plotted, and the GSA design matrix along with model outputs are saved for further post-processing (like the interaction and ratio analyses we discussed previously).

## Data Availability

The raw and processed data from the Global Sensitivity Analysis presented in this project, including the `gsa_results_with_inputs_df` and other relevant outputs, are too large to be hosted directly in this GitHub repository. They have been archived on Zenodo and are publicly available:

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    * R installed.
    * Required R packages installed: `deSolve`, `sensitivity`, `dplyr`, `parallel`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`. You can install them using:
        ```R
        install.packages(c("deSolve", "sensitivity", "dplyr", "parallel", "ggplot2", "tidyr"))
        ```
2.  **Clone the Repository** (if applicable).
3.  **Open `run_gsa_analysis.R`** in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
4.  **Adjust Parameters**:
    * Modify `baseline_params` in `run_gsa_analysis.R` if needed.
    * Update `gsa_parameters` in `run_gsa_analysis.R` to define the parameters you want to vary, their min/max ranges, and their sampling distributions (`uniform` or `loguniform`).
    * Adjust `n_base_samples` for the Sobol' sequence. Higher values give more robust indices but take longer to compute.
5.  **Run the Script**: Execute `run_gsa_analysis.R`.

The script will perform the GSA and save the Sobol' indices plot and an `.RData` file containing the Sobol' design object and the GSA results (including unscaled parameters and corresponding outputs) into the `results/` directory.

## Further Analysis

The output `gsa_results_with_inputs_df` (saved in the `.RData` file) from this GSA can be used as input for more detailed post-processing, such as:
* Scatter plots of individual parameters vs. the output.
* Fitting linear models to explore main effects.
* Investigating pairwise interactions (product terms).
* Testing specific non-linear relationships (e.g., ratios).
* Generating conditional effect plots.

## Code Overview

### `run_gsa_analysis.R`
* Loads required packages and sources helper functions.
* Defines global constants and baseline parameters.
* Sets up GSA parameters (ranges, distributions).
* Calls functions from `src/gsa_sobol_functions.R` to perform Sobol sampling and run simulations in parallel.
* Processes and plots Sobol' indices.
* Unscales parameter samples and saves the combined input-output dataframe.

### `src/model_and_metric_functions.R`
* `model_func_gsa`: The ODE function compatible with `deSolve::ode`.
* `calculate_protein_regulation_strength`: Calculates the output metric from ODE simulation results.

### `src/gsa_sobol_functions.R`
* `single_gsa_run`: A wrapper function to run a single ODE simulation with a given parameter set (unscaling parameters based on their distribution) and calculate the output metric. This is designed for use with `parApply`.
* (Potentially other helper functions for GSA setup or post-processing if you expand).
